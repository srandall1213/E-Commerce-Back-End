# E-Commerce-Back-End

## Description

My motivation in completing this project was to apply what I learned this week about Object Relational Mapping (ORM). I built this project because I wanted to test my skills and see if I could be effective in creating an E-Commerce Backend. The E-Commerce Backend solves the problem of getting, creating, updating, and deleting the database. Through this project I learned more about Sequelize, model/route/seed files, and how everything works together. I faced a few challenges with this project. One of them being the "npm run seed" command. I had to figure that out with my package.json.
